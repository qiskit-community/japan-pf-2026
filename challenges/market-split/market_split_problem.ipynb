    "# QDC 2025 Challenge - Track A <br> QOBLIB - Market Split Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge notebook, you’ll learn how to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems using quantum algorithms. Specifically, we’ll explore the Market Split problem — a challenging resource allocation task that becomes computationally intractable even for relatively small instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into four parts:\n",
    "- Part I: Learn the background of the Market Split problem, and how to fetch and load problem instances from the [Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library (QOBLIB) repository](https://git.zib.de/qopt/qoblib-quantum-optimization-benchmarking-library).\n",
    "- Part II: You’ll then convert the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) form using the brand new [Qiskit Optimization Mapper addon](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-opt-mapper) to be solved on a quantum computer.\n",
    "- Part III: See an example of solving the problem using a [Qiskit Function](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/guides/functions) — the [Kipu Iskay Optimizer](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/guides/kipu-optimization).\n",
    "- Part IV: Take on the challenge! You’ll tackle a complex instance of the Market Split problem using any quantum methods in your arsenal — whether it’s a Qiskit function, a custom QAOA, or other advanced techniques you’ll encounter throughout the QDC.\n",

    "### Background: The Market Split Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Market Split problem presents a deceptively simple yet computationally formidable challenge in resource allocation. Consider a company with $m$ products being sold across $n$ different markets, where each market purchases a specific bundle of products (represented by the columns of matrix $A$). The business objective is to partition these markets into two balanced sales regions such that each region receives exactly half the total demand for every product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "We seek a binary assignment vector $x$, where:\n",
    "- $x_j = 1$ assigns market $j$ to Region A\n",
    "- $x_j = 0$ assigns market $j$ to Region B\n",
    "- The constraint $Ax = b$ must be satisfied, where $b$ represents the target sales (typically half the total demand per product)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "Despite its straightforward business interpretation, this problem exhibits remarkable computational intractability:\n",
    "- **Small Scale Failure**: Conventional Mixed Integer Programming solvers fail on instances with as few as 7 products under a timeout of one hour [3].\n",
    "- **Exponential Growth**: The solution space grows exponentially ($2^n$ possible assignments), making brute force approaches infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This severe computational barrier, combined with its practical relevance to territory planning and resource allocation, makes the Market Split problem an ideal benchmark for quantum optimization algorithms. The problem instances used in this notebook come from the [Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library (QOBLIB) repository](https://git.zib.de/qopt/qoblib-quantum-optimization-benchmarking-library) [2], which provides standardized test cases for comparing classical and quantum optimization approaches."

    "### Data Loading and Problem Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's implement the practical steps to load our problem instance. We have two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Download**: Use `fetch_marketsplit_data()` to download directly from QOBLIB repository [2]\n",
    "2. **Manual Download + Parse**: Download the `.dat` file manually from the URL, then parse it with `parse_marketsplit_dat()`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Problem instances in QOBLIB are stored in a simple text format. Let's look at the actual content of our target instance [`ms_03_200_177.dat`](https://git.zib.de/qopt/qoblib-quantum-optimization-benchmarking-library/-/blob/main/01-marketsplit/instances/ms_03_200_177.dat?ref_type=heads):\n",

    "    - Product 3 sales per market and target (1040)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Market 0 sells: 60 units of Product 1, 176 units of Product 2, 68 units of Product 3\n",
    "- Market 1 sells: 92 units of Product 1, 196 units of Product 2, 68 units of Product 3\n",
    "- And so on for all 20 markets...\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ Ax = b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x ∈ \\{0,1\\}^n$, into a QUBO by penalizing constraint violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Penalty Method:**\n",
    "Since we need $Ax = b$ to hold exactly, we minimize the squared violation:\n",
    "$$f(x) = ||Ax - b||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equals zero precisely when all constraints are satisfied. Expanding algebraically:\n",
    "$$f(x) = (Ax - b)^T(Ax - b) = x^T A^T A x - 2b^T A x + b^T b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUBO Objective:**\n",
    "Since $b^T b$ is constant, our optimization becomes:\n",
    "$$\\text{minimize} \\quad Q(x) = x^T(A^T A)x - 2(A^T b)^T x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** This transformation is exact, not approximate. Equality constraints naturally square into quadratic form without requiring auxiliary variables or penalty parameters — making this formulation mathematically elegant and computationally efficient for quantum solvers [4]. We'll use the `OptimizationProblem` class to define our constrained problem, then convert it to QUBO format using `OptimizationProblemToQubo`. This automatically handles the penalty-based transformation."
