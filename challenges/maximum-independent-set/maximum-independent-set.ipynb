    "# QDC 2025 Challenge - Track B <br> QOBLIB - Maximum Independent Set Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge notebook, you'll learn how to tackle complex combinatorial optimizations using quantum algorithms. Specifically, we'll explore the Maximum Independent Set problem where we aim to find the largest set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (connected by an edge). This problem has numerous real-world applications including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network security**: Finding non-interfering communication channels\n",
    "- **Scheduling**: Assigning non-conflicting tasks or resources\n",
    "- **Molecular biology**: Analyzing protein interaction networks\n",
    "- **Social networks**: Identifying independent influential nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into three parts:\n",
    "- Part I: learn the background of the Maximum Indepdent Set problem and how to fetch and load problem instances from the [Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library (QOBLIB) repository](https://git.zib.de/qopt/qoblib-quantum-optimization-benchmarking-library)\n",
    "- Part II: You’ll then convert the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) form using the brand new [Qiskit Optimization Mapper Addon](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-opt-mapper) to be solved on a quantum computer.\n",
    "- Part III: See an example of solving the problem using a [Qiskit function](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/functions) — the [Q-CTRL Optimization Solver](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/q-ctrl-optimization-solver).\n",
    "- Part IV: Take on the challenge! You'll tackle a complex instance of the Maximum Indepdent Set problem using any quantum methods in your arsenal — whether it’s a Qiskit function, a custom QAOA, or other advanced techniques you’ll encounter throughout the QDC."
